# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to build a dynamic webpage which accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly.  This is accomplished by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page.  The content of this webpage is UFO Sightings, which contains data of various sightings from January 2010.  To make this webpage more interactive, and data more accessible, filters have been installed to allow for searches for specific attributes.

## Results
Below is a snapshot of the data, and filter search, displayed on the webpage.  This is the unfiltered data, with the input fields housing default data to demonstrate the format in which the data needs to be entered.

The next image is a snapshot of the data which is filtered by the city of El Cajon.  As observed, there are five sightings across two dates.

The user can filter on the fields date, city, state, country, or shape in any combination.  For the input to be accepted the user can press either the 'tab' or 'enter' key.

## Summary
While this webpage satisfies the requirements, there are additional features that can be applied.  For instance, one drawback is the user must be familiar with the data to effectively use the filter capabilities.  Therefore, a recommendation for further development would be to install dropdown lists into the input fields instead of text boxes.  This would allow users to understand the options available to them and eliminate errors due to incorrect format.

Another recommendation is to install a button that would allow the user to download the data into a csv file.  While the webpage does a great job of displaying the data, users might want to store the data elsewhere either to have it more accessible or to conduct further analysis.
